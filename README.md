# Organic-Food

This is my second project

We are in an era where information technology makes buying and selling easier than ever. People can order an expensive phone to a daily kitchenware and everything is completed electronically and interactively in real- time. 

Organic food is also out of this cycle. 

Therefore, we are developing a website named Organic Product to bring good products to more customers.
Organic Product is for an organization who wants to develop an online store where their users can be a person who does not have much time to go to the organic product store or person has shopping online habit or just simply they stay too far from standalone store. 

It will provide its user the following features. 

For Organic Product’s customer: 
      •	Customer can register account.
      •	Customer can login and manage their account.
      •	Customer can search any products such as: vegetables, food, canned foods, etc.
      •	Customer can search products by price. 
      •	Customer can see products’ introduction before buying. 
      •	Customer can buy products after adding products to cart. 
      •	Customer can view cart history. 
      •	Customer can check out.
